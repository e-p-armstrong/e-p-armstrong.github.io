            <h3>Humanity Endures</h3>
            <p>I'm an author! Once upon a time I was bored, and so I decided to spend the next three years of my life writing a 300,000-word science fiction book. And you know what, I don't think it <i>completely</i> sucks either! Should you have a few weeks to spare you might want to give it a read. (And to answer the inevitable question, I am actually planning another one now.)</p>

           <h3>Coding Projects</h3>
            <p>I've been learning to code on-and-off for much of my life, and I've been truly committed to it for the past year or so. From Haskell (via the <a href="https://haskellbook.com/" target="_blank">Haskellbook</a>) to Python with <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/"> Learn Python The Hard Way</a> to Codecademy's "Full Stack Engineer" course (which is what I'm currently working through) I've done a fair bit of stuff. And I learned how to use Github a month or two ago so I'm now adding projects there whenever I have the time in-between midterms/finals. If you want to see them, the button is there!</p>
            <p> You can check my Github account out here:</p>

Merge it with the .button-span a{} ruleset. That'll be cleaner.-->
