            <h3>Humanity Endures</h3>
            <p>I'm an author! Once upon a time I was bored, and so I decided to spend the next three years of my life writing a 300,000-word science fiction book. And you know what, I don't think it <i>completely</i> sucks either! Should you have a few weeks to spare you might want to give it a read. (And to answer the inevitable question, I am actually planning another one now.)</p>

           <h3>Coding Projects</h3>
            <p>I've been learning to code on-and-off for much of my life, and I've been truly committed to it for the past year or so. From Haskell (via the <a href="https://haskellbook.com/" target="_blank">Haskellbook</a>) to Python with <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/"> Learn Python The Hard Way</a> to Codecademy's "Full Stack Engineer" course (which is what I'm currently working through) I've done a fair bit of stuff. And I learned how to use Github a month or two ago so I'm now adding projects there whenever I have the time in-between midterms/finals. If you want to see them, the button is there!</p>
            <p> You can check my Github account out here:</p>

           <h4>Hey, while we're talking about code...</h4>
           <p>There's a bunch of cool stuff in the "coding projects" page of this site. Check the navbar. In the meantime, you can get this exceedingly simple program to call you and your loved ones names. The neatest thing about this is that it's integrated with the site itself (runs on the web) but all of the things in the "coding projects" area do that too, and 3/4 of them take input. They're seriously cooler. Check them out. Or just...</p>
