    <div>Note: This is a presentation I made for my Grade 12 "Capstone" project. It basically goes over some things I had done by that point, and what my plans are. You can read through it if you wish but most of the presentation was spoken so it might be a bit annoying.</div>
    <div>Also, the navbar wasn't here originally, and it isn't here after this slide until slide 13. If you want to leave you should do so here.</div>
