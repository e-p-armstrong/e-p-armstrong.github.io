            <h3 id="testinginteract">A Caesar Cipher</h3>
            <p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. I made a Caesar Cipher class that lets you create an object with a given shift, and this object has methods that let you encrypt and decrypt text at will. The version customized for this page lets you change the input, and handles/displays errors/bad inputs smoothly (try-catch). Try encrypting and decrypting any messages you want!</p>

            <h3>A Number Formatter</h3>
            <p>A neat little function that, relatively efficiently, takes a number, turns it into a string, and adds commas in the correct places such that it is transformed into a (you guessed it) formatted number (commas in-between every three characters). This thing even works with decimals.</p>

            <p>Try it out by entering numbers in the box below! (Try it with decimals!)</p>

            <h3>A Password Generator</h3>
            <p>Mashes together a bunch of random characters to make a somewhat secure password, probably. It uses Math.random though so it probably isn't cryptographically sound. I still can't imagine the things it produces would be easy to guess or brute force, however.</p>

            <h4>Luhn's Algorithm</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The outcome of a Codecademy "Challenge Project" -- it uses something called Luhn's Algorithm, which detects (most) typographical mistakes in important numbers. Basically, this checks if an array of numbers follows a specific pattern, returns true if it does, and false if it does not.</p>

            <h3>The page you're looking at</h3>
            <p>My largest progest so far is probably actually the stylesheet that governs the main page of this site (this page runs that stylesheet with a few quick additions). Its purpose is to display any page written with semantic HTML in a beautiful dark theme with well-structured content. It has everything from CSS Grid to pseudo-elements to media queries, and I believe it has unique rules for every single semantic tag (at least, all the ones in W3 schools' list). I'm pretty happy with it!</p>
            <p>(Also, integrating all these programs with this page was a project in and of itself, which probably took more time than it took to write all of them. I improved them all a bunch during this process too.)</p>
            <p>You can check out its Github page here:</p>
