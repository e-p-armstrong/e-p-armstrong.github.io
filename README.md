My personal Github Pages website, where I practice my front-end, display a portfolio of sorts, and more. The HTML is semantic, the CSS uses a slightly-modified version of my general-purpose stylesheet (so there's everything from CSS Grid to pseudo elements to Media Queries in there!) and there's even a bit of Javascript. So it's no longer bare-bones. 

Being a portfolio, this is where you go to see all the nifty things I've done. Recently, I added a link to a full-blown React app that I made. I also might start blogging here in the future, if I wish to channel Zuckerberg.

Stay tuned for future updates, and check in occasionally to see the latest "distinguished person of the [timeframe]"!
