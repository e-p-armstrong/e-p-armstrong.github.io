My personal Github Pages website, where I practice my front-end, display a portfolio of sorts, and more. The HTML is semantic, the CSS uses a slightly-modified version of my general-purpose stylesheet (so there's everything from CSS Grid to pseudo elements to Media Queries in there!) and there's even a bit of Javascript. So it's no longer bare-bones. 

I'll keep updating this as I get better at coding/website building! Next-up: a hell of a lot more Javascript! I'm going to make this thing a playground of miscellaneous hobby projects.
