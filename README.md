My personal Github Pages website, where I practice my front-end, display a portfolio of sorts, and more. The HTML is semantic, the CSS uses fancy-ish things (fancy for me) like pseudo classes and pseudo elements, there is a bit of Javascript in there... it's no longer bare-bones, at the very least. 

Will be continuously updated as I get better at coding/website building!
